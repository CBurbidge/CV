# CV
My CV, in JSON form

There's a fair bit of nonsense required to 'build' this. Need powershell, python (with beautifulsoup4) and node installed.

The .json itself deviates from the json resume schema to allow UK grades and i've tweaked the 'flat' theme from https://github.com/francescoes/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow to render the grades.
